"Dear One   Greetings to you. I thank God that I have come across you and believe you will not turn down my request. My name is mariam guei I am almost 20 years old girl now and i am from Bouke in Cote D'ivoire, west Africa.     I became an orphan last year when my father and my mother were murdered in Bouke in the northen part of Cote D'ivoire(Ivorycoast)my home town. I was in school when the rebel new force went on rampage and killed people in the town suspected for supporting the government of Gbagbo. I was taken from the school by a good samaritan to Abidjan, where I am now on refuge. I am now staying with the old woman I call aunty, she is 81 years old and she has been trying her best for me I am confused and i don't know  what to do to claim my late father's deposit in security company here in Abidjan here.     He deposited a sum of ($15,000,000)(Fifteen million) dollars only. This deposit was to be sent to his business partner in Europe but since the crisis they lost contact and I dont know about him and I dont know about their transaction before he died.   I am appealing to you in the name of God to help me contact the Security Company where my late father deposited this fund as family valuables so that they can convey the consignment to you in your country through their diplomatic means according to the security company Director and after you have received this consignment you will have to transfer it into your bank account as well as a safe place for me to move to after the conclusion of this transaction. I believe you are a reliable person that will not sit on the money and will provide a safe place where I can move to continue my studies which is my priority in life because this civil war here has almost distablized everything and my education is suspended for my security reasons.      I promise to give you 20% of the total amount after the conclusion of the transaction. That will cover all your inconveniences or probably any expensis while helping me Please send to me your telephone no. and let me know if you can reliably keep this only thing I have left in life with you safely.Why i want to leave here for western world where i can restart my life is because of everyday political and economic instability and civil unrest as well as looting and raping which is the order of the day now. Pls. if you know that you are going to be very honest with me do let me know by your email.     I wait to hear from you soon,  Yours faithfully,  mariam guei  ---------------------------------Easy + Joy + Powerful = Yahoo! Bookmarks x Toolbar"

This is not a fair assessment of the position we have taken. We have more than tripled to level of assistance from whatwas proposed in the last Administration and have expressed flexibility about how to structure it. Jeff has consistentlybeen pushing the Palauns to press for more. Kurt reached out to him per your instruction and we will get you acomplete memo.

"AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.Attention Please,I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development.The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you.I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,Yours faithfully,Musa Garuba._________________________________________________________________MSN Hotmail sur i-mode : envoyez et recevez des e-mails depuis votre tlphone portable ! http://www.msn.fr/hotmailimode/"

Otherwise theEstate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by thebank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank wherethe deceased had an account valued at about $5million U.S dollars(  fiveMillion United State of America dollars).Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or havethe account confiscated within the next ten official working days. since ihave been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over severalyears now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of thedeceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $5million U.Sdollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share themoney.I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claimwe may make.

"=20                     CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSALYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know m=e personally.I got your contact through network online hence decided to wri=te you. I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your i=ntegrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for= foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent N=kono, the first son of  Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular black farmer =in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduc=ed a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some f=ew black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbab=wean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people= were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of= the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zi=mbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands w=here we are seeking political asylum.Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit t=he sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United States= dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the loomin=g danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avo=id much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purc=hase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new f=arms in Swaziland.=20Now the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliabl=e foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum= seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transa=ction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of =my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreig=n account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my= government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South Africa=n government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the =dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of goin=g through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries= have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partn=er who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I mu=st let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current statu=s in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this tr=ansaction with you.=20If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is t=o make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(f=unds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already= given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from= South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place =like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete= arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearan=ce from the Security Company.=20I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage =of the money immediately after the funds hit your account, or you can go in=to partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in= your country. Whichever the option you want, it is opened for negotiation.==20I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred =in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am= willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for m=y investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the =above email address,  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy =required in this transaction.Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU=20Yours Faithfully,=20George Nduumba.=20Freeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save =A37.50 a mont=h=20www.freeserve.com/anytime"

"B.P 2341 Lome Togo.West- Africa.My name is Mr. Balarabe Zamani, the Manager, credit and foreign bills  of ECOWAS BANK LIMITED  Lome Togo .I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number D14-A55-096/utb/t who perished in a plane crash[Ethiopian airline 961] with the whole passengers aboard.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.28.5 m, [twenty-eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time.        On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up  to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than Eight  years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.   In view of this I got your contact through a search on the internet .I  shall   give you 40% of the total sum .I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and thatyou should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to thedeceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your privatetel/ fax numebrs for quick communication. Respectfully submitted,MR.Balarabe   ZamaniManager, Credit and Foreign Bills"
